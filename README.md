MNIST synthetic digits generation using simple GAN architecture

This project ventures into this fascinating realm by harnessing the power of GANs to tackle the iconic MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The network learns to generate virtual representations of these digits, mimicking their characteristics with increasing fidelity, though alternate training of generator and discriminator.
